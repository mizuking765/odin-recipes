        <h1>Bangin' Bolognese Sauce</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a bolognese sauce I learned about from an Australian Youtuber named Nat's What I Reckon. After utilizing and practicing with his recipe, I made small tweaks based on available ingredients in California.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Spoonful of butter</li>
            <li>Dash of olive oil</li>
            <li>2 sticks of celery</li>
            <li>3 medium sized carrots <strong>or</strong> 1-2 large carrots</li>
            <li>1-2 onions, with the type of onion being up to you. Personally, I like sweet yellow onions</li>
            <li>200g of bacon</li>
            <li>1.5kg of ground/mince beef</li>
            <li>300g of tomato <em>paste</em></li>
            <li>500ml of chicken stock</li>
            <li>1 bottle of cheap red wine (cabernet sauvignon or  merlot).</li>
            <li>250-ish ml of milk</li>
            <li>An amount of parmesean or pecorino cheese</li>
            <li>Lots of time</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The Process</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Dice all your vegetables and toss them into a mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>Cut your bacon up into small pieces and add it into the same mixing bowl with your veggies.</li>
            <li>Throw your fats (butter and olive oil) into a big ol' pot on high heat, and add in your mixing bowl of diced up veggies and bacon.</li>
            <li>Keep it hot and stir, since we want all that bacon fat to add flavor.</li>
            <li>Add in the rest of your meat after you've started stirring up the veggies and bacon.</li>
            <li>Render out the fat from the beef and bacon.</li>
            <li>If you're following the recipe so far and using the same amounts of each ingredient, add in about half that bottle of wine.</li>
            <li>Let this cook and reduce the wine. We want the flavor of the wine, not the alcohol content.</li>
            <li>After the wine's reduced a bit, add in your tomato paste.</li>
            <li>Stir well to mix the tomato paste into your concoction.</li>
            <li>Once it's mixed well, add your milk and chicken stock.</li>
            <li>Stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Add in some pepper. We don't need to add salt yet, since the chicken stock is pretty salty already.</li>
            <li>Give it a good stir to make sure all the flavors are mixing together.</li>
            <li>Pop the lid on the pot, turn down the heat to low/medium-low, and let it ride. I usually cook mine for about 6 hours, adding chicken stock if the sauce thickens too much.</li>
            <li>After the time's up, go ahead and take the lid off and serve it on whatever you want. Pasta? Go for it. Rice? Let's do it.</li>
            <li>Remember how I said "an amount of parmesean or pecorino cheese" at the start? Add as much as you want. I don't care. I'm lactose-intolerant and I'll add at least 100 grams of cheese.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Wham, bam, thank you ma'am. You're done. That's everything you need for an absolutely bangin' bolognese. Big props to Nat for the base recipe.</p>
