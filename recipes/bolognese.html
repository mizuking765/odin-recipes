        <h1>Bangin' Bolognese Sauce</h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a bolognese sauce I learned about from an Australian Youtuber named Nat's What I Reckon. After utilizing and practicing with his recipe, I made small tweaks based on available ingredients in California.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Spoonful of butter</li>
            <li>Dash of olive oil</li>
            <li>2 sticks of celery</li>
            <li>3 medium sized carrots <strong>or</strong> 1-2 large carrots</li>
            <li>1-2 onions, with the type of onion being up to you. Personally, I like sweet yellow onions</li>
            <li>200 grams of bacon</li>
            <li>1.5 kilograms of ground/mince beef</li>
            <li>2 small cans of tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 big box of chicken stock</li>
            <li>1 bottle of cheap red wine (cabernet sauvignon or  merlot).</li>
            <li>250-ish milliliters of milk</li>
            <li>Lots of time</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The Process</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Dice all your vegetables and toss them into a mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>Cut your bacon up into small pieces and add it into the same mixing bowl with your veggies.</li>
            <li>Throw your fats (butter and olive oil) into a big ol' pot on high heat, and add in your mixing bowl of diced up veggies and bacon.</li>
            <li>Keep it hot and stir, since we want all that bacon fat to add flavor.</li>
            <li>Add in the rest of your meat after you've started stirring up the veggies and bacon.</li>
            <li>Render out the fat from the beef and bacon.</li>
            <li>If you're following the recipe so far and using the same amounts of each ingredient, add in about half that bottle of wine.</li>
        </ol>
